# Description

This is my capstone project for CodeCademy's "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" course. Using skills learned in the course I created this responsive landing page for a new school using a wireframe document and assets provided by CodeCademy. You can find it here: https://zechos.github.io/colmar/

Skills utilized for this project include CSS, HTML, color theory, typography, website layout and positioning, responsive design, accessibility, and version control using git via the commandÂ line.
